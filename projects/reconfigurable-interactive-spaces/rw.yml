  Summary:
    Overview:
      - "interaction mediated by 5 proxemic dimensions: distance, orientation, movement, identity, location"
      - "fixed and semifixed features"
      - "compensation, balance, and privacy"
      - "4 proxemic zones: intimate, personal, social, public (supporting different input modalities and interactions"
      - "3 action spaces: o-space, p-space, r-space" 
      - "grounded by social theories"
    Key Challenges:
      - 1. Revealing interaction possibilities
        - "Weiser: 'most profound technologies disappear…'"
        - "transitioning from background to foreground interaction"
        - "directing user’s attention (metaphor: greeting)"
      - 2. Directing Actions
        - "multimodal input (speech, gesture, gaze, and touch, etc) as actions to the system or just a part of a person's activity?'"
        - "directing user’s attention (metaphor: greeting)"
        - "motion cues (and understanding the entire physical space)"
