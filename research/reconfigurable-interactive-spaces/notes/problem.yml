Goals:
  - "UIST'18 best paper"
  - "CHI'19 best paper"

Problems:
  - "End-users ignore or are unware of cross-device opportunities in interactive spaces"
  - "Activities and work are constantly disrupted and often fragmented across devices and spaces"
  - "Being sane during constant activity and work switching"
  - "Doing cross-domain interdisciplinary work is hard: professional vs. non-professional, expert vs. lay person"
  - "Poor communication between HCI and other discplines and the public"

Research Questions:
  - "What are the <u>technical and social constructs of interactive spaces</u>? Is it a layered structure? How can it be <u>visualized?</u> Does it help people see what's in a space?"
  - "What is <u>reconfigurability in interactive spaces</u>? <u>contextual reconfiguration?</u> (changes to the context - <u>identity</u>, <u>location</u>, <u>status (activity of people and devices)</u>, and <u>time</u>). <u>Automatic or manual?</u> (configuration work) Or both? What <u>theories</u> are behind this?"
  - "What is a <u>good interaction experience</u> in multi-device (reconfigurable) environments/systems?"
  - "Design interactive systems/spaces that support <u>changing contexts</u> - identity, location, status (activity), time - adaptive interfaces and personalized preferences (or interaction modes)?"
  - "Design <u>cross-device interaction techniques</u> that enables groups to create, distribute, store, resume, reconfigure, and remove work, as well as to form new groups and split existing groups."
  - "How can <u>high-level, long-term, dynamic human goals or activities</u> be supported across spaces and devices (e.g., always at hand)? How does it integrate with the physical world? How can <u>malleable interactive spaces</u> support these kinds of high-level goals? Potentially supporting multiple goals for multiple people?"
  - "Gestures for <u>opting in and out</u> of interactive systems or spaces"
  - "<u>Informing users</u> what they are doing and what the system is doing"
  - "What are the <u>killer apps/interaction techniques/designs/experiences?</u>"
  - "<u>Sensing high-level activities and actions</u>: action inference and social inference <u>(keep human in the loop)</u>"
  - "Really really need <u>long-term in-the-field/in-the-wild studies and evaluation</u>, e.g., challenges and opportunities in the classrooms"
