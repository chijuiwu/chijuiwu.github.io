Goals:
  - "UIST'18 best paper"
  - "CHI'19 best paper"

Problems:
  - "P1"
  - "P2"
  - "P3"

Research Questions:
  - "What are the <u>technical and social constructs of interactive spaces</u>? Is it a layered structure? How can it be visualized? Does it help people see what's in a space?"
  - "What is <u>reconfigurability in interactive spaces</u>? <u>contextual reconfiguration?</u> (changes to the context - <u>identity</u>, <u>location</u>, <u>status (activity)</u>, and <u>time</u>). <u>automatic or manual?</u> (configuration work)"
  - "Design interactive systems/spaces that support <u>changing contexts</u> - adaptive interfaces and personalized preferences (or interaction modes)?"
  - "Design <u>cross-device interaction techniques</u> that enables groups to create, distribute, store, resume, reconfigure, and remove work, as well as to form new groups and split existing groups."
  - "How can <u>high-level, long-term, dynamic human goals or activities</u> be supported across spaces and devices (e.g., always at hand)? How does it integrate with the physical world? How can <u>malleable interactive spaces</u> support these kinds of high-level goals? Potentially supporting multiple goals for multiple people?"
  - "<u>Informing users</u> what they are doing and what the system is doing"
  - "What are the <u>killer apps?</u>"
  - "<u>Sensing high-level activities and actions</u>: action inference and social inference (keep human in the loop)"
  - "Really really need <u>long-term in-the-field/in-the-wild studies and evaluation</u>"
