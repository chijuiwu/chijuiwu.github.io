    Summary:
      - Title: "Overview"
        Body:
          - "interaction mediated by 5 proxemic dimensions: distance, orientation, movement, identity, location"
          - "fixed and semifixed features"
          - "compensation, balance, and privacy"
          - "4 proxemic zones: intimate, personal, social, public (supporting different input modalities and interactions"
          - "3 action spaces: o-space, p-space, r-space"
          - "grounded by social theories"
      - Title: "Key Challenges"
        Body:
          - SubTitle: "1. Revealing interaction possibilities"
            Content:
              - "Weiser: most profound technologies disappear…"
              - "transitioning from background to foreground interaction"
              - "directing user's attention (metaphor: greeting)"
          - SubTitle: "2. Directing Actions"
            Content:
              - "multimodal input (speech, gesture, gaze, and touch, etc) as actions to the system or just a part of a person's activity?"
              - "directing user's attention (metaphor: greeting)"
              - "motion cues (and understanding the entire physical space)"
          - SubTitle: "3. Establishing Connections"
            Content:
              - "supporting interaction needs while safeguarding privacy and security (personal, private, and public relationships)"
              - "different form factors demand different mobilities"
              - "progressive (discrete or continuous) connection and interaction"
          - SubTitle: "4. Providing Feedback"
            Content:
              - "application status (or errors) and its interpretation of user input, accounting for users’ attention"
              - "output modalities (sound, speech, perception, movement)"
          - SubTitle: "5. Avoiding and Correcting Mistakes"
            Content:
              - "more user-control"
