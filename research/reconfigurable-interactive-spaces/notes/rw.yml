        Authors: "Ballendat et al., ITS'10"

    Overview:
      - "interaction mediated by 5 proxemic dimensions: distance, orientation, movement, identity, location"
      - "fixed and semifixed features"
      - "compensation, balance, and privacy"
      - "4 proxemic zones: intimate, personal, social, public (supporting different input modalities and interactions"
      - "3 action spaces: o-space, p-space, r-space"
      - "grounded by social theories"
    
    Applications and Scenarios:
      - "reacting to proxemic dimensions (media player, public displays)"
      - "spatially visualizing ubicomp spaces (supporting device discovery, interaction possibilities and spontaneous interactions)"

    Key Challenges:
      - Title: "1. Revealing interaction possibilities"
        Notes:
        - "Weiser: most profound technologies disappear…"
        - "transitioning from background to foreground interaction"
        - "directing user's attention (metaphor: greeting)"
      - Title: "2. Directing Actions"
        Notes:
          - "multimodal input (speech, gesture, gaze, and touch, etc) as actions to the system or just a part of a person's activity?"
          - "directing user's attention (metaphor: greeting)"
          - "motion cues (and understanding the entire physical space)"
      - Title: "3. Establishing Connections"
        Notes:
          - "supporting interaction needs while safeguarding privacy and security (personal, private, and public relationships)"
          - "different form factors demand different mobilities"
          - "progressive (discrete or continuous) connection and interaction"
      - Title: "4. Providing Feedback"
        Notes:
          - "application status (or errors) and its interpretation of user input, accounting for users’ attention"
          - "output modalities (sound, speech, perception, movement)"
      - Title: "5. Avoiding and Correcting Mistakes"
        Notes:
            - "more user-control"
