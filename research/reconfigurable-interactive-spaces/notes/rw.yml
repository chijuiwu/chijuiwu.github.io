    Overview:
      - "interaction mediated by 5 proxemic dimensions: distance, orientation, movement, identity, location"
      - "fixed and semifixed features"
      - "compensation, balance, and privacy"
      - "4 proxemic zones: intimate, personal, social, public (supporting different input modalities and interactions"
      - "3 action spaces: o-space, p-space, r-space"
      - "grounded by social theories"
    
    Applications and Scenarios:
      - "systems reacting to proxemic dimensions (Ballendat's media player, proxemic-aware displays, surfaces, and installations, spatially-aware mobile devices supporting cross-device interaction and small-group activities)"
      - "spatially visualizing ubicomp spaces (supporting device discovery, conveying interaction possibilities, and enabling spontaneous interactions)"

    Key Challenges:
      - Title: "1. Revealing interaction possibilities"
        Notes:
        - "Weiser: most profound technologies disappear…"
        - "transitioning from background to foreground interaction"
        - "directing user's attention (metaphor: greeting)"
      - Title: "2. Directing Actions"
        Notes:
          - "multimodal input (speech, gesture, gaze, and touch, etc) as actions to the system or just a part of a person's activity?"
          - "directing user's attention (metaphor: greeting)"
          - "motion cues (and understanding the entire physical space)"
      - Title: "3. Establishing Connections"
        Notes:
          - "supporting interaction needs while safeguarding privacy and security (personal, private, and public relationships)"
          - "different form factors demand different mobilities"
          - "progressive (discrete or continuous) connection and interaction"
      - Title: "4. Providing Feedback"
        Notes:
          - "application status (or errors) and its interpretation of user input, accounting for users’ attention"
          - "output modalities (sound, speech, perception, movement)"
      - Title: "5. Avoiding and Correcting Mistakes"
        Notes:
            - "more user-control (mechanisms for correcting errors and misinterprations of e.g., from the use sensing technologies)"
            - "inverting actions (stepping out of the interaction zone)"
            - "undoing actions / overriding the system (towards direct manipulation)"
            - "using proxemic safeguards (requiring certain proxemic relationships for actions with a high impact)"
      - Title: "6. Managing Privacy and Security"
        Notes:
            - "protect privacy-sensitive information and handle access to information"
            - "not get in the way of doing things (points 1-5)"
            - "proxemity-dependent authentication"
            - "distance-dependent information disclosure"
            - "proxemic-aware privacy mechanisms (considering orientation, identity, and location)"
            - "considering people's expectations (levels of privacy for everyone involved, their social relationships, balancing privacy through proxemics)"

    So What:
      - "<strong>GREAT WORK!!!</strong> New design thinking for ubicomp interactive systems and cross-device interaction!!!"
      - "towards <strong>ad hoc</strong> device ecologies - activity, space, and time - and <strong>reconfigurable</strong> interactive spaces"
      - "<strong>identity</strong> - what about social relationships? implications for proxemic interaction design (proxemic social contact)?"
      - "<strong>cultural differences</strong> (concepts of personal spaces and space invasion) not discussed"
      - "<strong>deliberatly violating expectations</strong> of proxemic interaction in certain applications (e.g., close physical interaction or human interaction/activity)"
      - "<strong>social concerns</strong> about privacy, errors, distraction, and intrusion"
      - "<strong>dark patterns</strong> (Greenberg et al., DIS'14'): captive audience, attention grabber, bait and switch, making personal information public, we never forget, disguised data collection, social network of proxemic contacts or unintended social relationships, and the milk factor. Opt-in and opt-out mechanisms? New user-defined interaction possibilities?"
      - "<strong>proxemic interaction challeges</strong> (Greenberg et al., DIS'14'): opt-in/opt-out choices, physical space is imbued with dual meanings, ownership of the physical space is ambiguous, attention is inherently sought after (being in a space but opted out of the interactive system), accidental proxemics (interaction with context-aware systems), balancing between implicit and explicit interaction, making users aware of what is happening, "
      - "<strong>design implications</strong> for the Physical Web and IoT. Cloud vs. local infrastructures."
      - "Proxemic theory also applies to the dis-abled (visually impaired/blind people have good spatial awareness, they know whether the other person talking is facing them, and more) but most cross-device interactions still rely heavily on visual cues. Would be very interesting to work on <strong>accessibility issues</strong> in cross-device interaction (This is a big topic, perhaps a PhD by itself) so it'd require collaboration. I think the big problem is helping them connect with people, feel loved, do essential/meaningful work, and enhance their own abilities/interests (ability-based design), etc (somewhat universal to all humans). Technologies (e.g., cross-device interaction) are just tools, so creating the right tool for the right purpose/problem is important (inclusive design)."
