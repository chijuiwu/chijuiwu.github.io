    Overview:
      - "<i>The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.</i>"
      - "<i>Specialized elements of hardware and software connected by wires, radio waves and infrared, will be so ubiquitous that no one will notice their presence.</i>"
      - "<i>There is more information available at our fingertips during a walk in the woods than in any computer system, yet people find a walk among trees relaxing and computers frustrating. Machines that fit the human environment instead of forcing humans to enter theirs will make using a computer as refreshing as taking a walk in the woods.</i>"
      - "people primarily work in a world of shared situations and unexamined technological skills; theories: Situated Learning"
      - "new kind of computer that is situated in the world of concrete information conveyors"
      - "ubiquitous and natural like <u>writing</u> and <u>pen and paper</u> - silicon-based information technology is far from having become a part of the environment"
      - "making computing an <u>integral, invisible</u> part of people's lives - such disappearance is a consequence of <u>human psychology</u> (phenomenon: <u>compiling</u>; <u>tacit dimension</u>; <u>visual invariants</u>; <u>horizon</u> and <u>ready-to-hand</u>; <u>periphery</u>)"
      - "so that we can focus on our tasks, activities, and goals - people will simply use them unconsciously to accomplish everyday tasks"
      - "ubiquitous computing and virtual reality at opposing ends of an information technology spectrum"

    Ubiquitous Computers:
      - "interconnected, location- and scale-aware devices come to be <u>invisible to common awareness</u> - not personal computers but as a pervasive part of everyday life"
      - "<u>tabs (inch-scale post-it notes)</u>: e.g., active badges (enabling tracking of the people or objects) and radio receivers that link pads and other computer devices to the network"
      - "<u>pads (foot-scale papers)</u>: scrap computers available everywhere (no individualized identity or importance) and are spread out on the table"
      - "<u>boards (yard-scale displays)</u> displays, bulletin boards, whiteboards, or flip charts (enhanced human-computer interaction) in the home and office (owned by spaces, not people), supporting meeting rooms scenarios and collaboration (in collocated and remote spaces)"
      - "these devices are just the beginning - the real power of ubiquitous computing emerges from the <u>interaction of all of them</u> (a pleasant and effective place to get things done)"
      - "hardware and software <u>configurations can change on demand</u> while the devices are running"

    Applications and Scenarios:
      - "embedded virtuality: doors open only to the right person, rooms greet people by name, telephone calls are automatically forwarded to where the recipient may be, computer terminals retrieve the preferences of whoever is sitting at them, and appointment diaries write themselves"
      - "locating people and devices"
      - "objects finding their way and machines doing their work automatically"
      - "activity and task notifications on displays at convenient times, with audio and visual feedback"
      - "shared virtual office: shared access to their location detectors, screen contents and location"
      - "tab displays that be enlarged and minimized showing peripheral changes"
      - "shared media and documents accessible and editable on a range of devices"
      - "gestures used to point to devices and a variety of input techniques"
      - "smart search"
      - "user controlling the access of private information"

    Grand Challenges:
      1. Invisible computers:
        - "embedding technology into everyday lives and practices"
      2. Virtual reality:
        - "the computer is not out of the way"
        - "the goal of leaving the everyday physical world behind - at odds with Ubiquitous Computing's goal of better integrating the computer into human activities, since humans are of and in the everyday world"
      3. Hardware Components:
        - "low-power computing"
        - "low-power high-bits/cubic meter communication"
        - "pen devices"

        - "wireless media access (to a physical medium)"
        - "wide-band-width range"
        - "real-time capabilities for multimedia over standard networks"
        - "reliable packet routing"
        - "short-range wireless, long-range wireless, and high speed wired networks supporting hundreds (even thousands) of devices in a room"
      5. Interaction Substrates:
        - "interaction techniques as well as input and output modalities for different form factors at room-scale"
        - "window migration across multiple devices"
        - "applications that peregrinate from computer to computer and space to space"
        - "exploiting the unique capabilities of distributed computers and their physical locations"
      6. Applications:
        - "shareable media and tools - the number of shared items and users"
        - "software modules can be readily added or removed, and operating systems can shrink and grow automatically to fit the changing needs of ubiquitous computation"
        - "invisibility, integrating the physical and virtual, collaboration and information filtering"
      7. Privacy of location:
        - "preserving privacy"
        - "user control"
        - "social issues must be considered separately"
      8. Computational Methods:
        - "optimal cache sharing for portable computer architectures"

    So What:
      - "alright <u>Mark Weiser is my hero</u>"
      - "ubicomp inspired a whole generation of researchers"
      - "developing <u>calm technology</u> (which informs but doesn't demand our focus or attention) is a key goal"
      - "however the concept of <u>personal devices</u> is still engrained in our thinking (our smartphones are a personal extension of ourselves); we rarely use public, shared devices"
      - "a good grounding for cross-device interaction and application scenarios"
      - "cross-disciplinary work"
      - "interaction techniques for ad hoc collaboration in device ecologies"
      - "How do users of various abilities perceive interactive spaces? and interaction techniques for multi-device environments?"
      - "How do users (or groups) spatially distribute devices in interactive spaces?"

        Authors: "Dey, Abowd, Salber, HCI'01"

    Overview:
      - "<u>context</u>: any information that can be used to characterize <u>the situation of entities</u> (i.e., <u>person</u>, <u>place</u>, or <u>physical</u> or <u>computational object</u>) that are considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and the application themselves. Context is typically the location, identity and state of people, groups, and computational and physical objects"
      - "context also includes: lighting, noise level, network connectivity, communication costs and bandwidth, and even social situation"
      - "<u>goal of context acquisition</u>: determine what a user is trying to accomplish"
      - "<u>categories of context</u>: identity, location, status (activity), and time"
      - "<u>context-awareness</u>: the use of context to provide task-relevant information and/or services to a user"
      - "<u>categories of context-aware functions</u>: presentation of information and services, automatic execution of services, and attaching context information for later retrieval"
      - "<u>categories of contextual components</u>: context widgets acquire context information, interpreters transform and raise the level of abstraction of context information, aggregators gather context information related to an entity, services execute behaviours on the environment using acquired context, discoveries allow applications (and other components) to determine the capabilities of the environment and to take advantage of them."

    Context-Aware Computing:
      - "<i>People and their machines should be able to access information and communicate with each other easily and securely, in any medium or combination of media - voice, data, image, video, or multimedia - any time, anywhere, in a timely, cost-effective way.</i>"
      - "the user may <u>move from one location to another</u>, <u>joining and leaving groups of people</u>, and <u>frequently interacting with computers</u> while in <u>changing social situations</u>, leading to personalization of application and appliances"
      - "systems that <u>examine and react</u> to an individual's <u>changing context</u> which spans <u>a multitude of situations and locations</u> covering the office, meeting room, home, airport, hotel, classroom, etc"
      - "<u>adapts</u> to the location of use (<u>where you are</u>), the connection of nearby people (<u>who you are with</u>), hosts, and accessible devices (<u>what resources are nearby</u>)"
      - "<u>examines the computing environment</u> and <u>reacts to changes</u> in the environment"
      - "<u>requirements</u>: separation of concerns (between application semantics and context acquisitions), context interpretation, transparent, distributed communications, constant availability of context acquisition, context storage and history, and resource discovery"
      - "<u>context toolkit</u>: distributed communications using HTTP and XML, subscriptions, parallel asynchronous event handling, discovery, context services"

    Proximate Selection:
      - "entering a <u>locus</u> and a <u>selection</u>"
      - "<u>located-objects</u>: input and output devices, digital objects and services, and places"

    Automatic Contextual Reconfiguration:
      - "<u>reconfiguration</u>: adding new components, removing existing components, or altering the connections between components (servers, loadable device drivers, program modules, hardware elements, etc)"
      - "<u>contextual reconfiguration</u>: context of use can bring about different <u>system configurations and adaptations</u>, enabling access of virtual objects as if they were physical and follow particular users from room to room"
      - "context may be rapidly changing even during use! or incorrectly reported"

    Contextual Information and Commands:
      - "context can parameterize <u>contextual commands</u>"
      - "for example, location-based filesystem that display directories based on user's location"
      - "programs (user interface and commands) can also leverage contextual information"
      - "potential for personal customization"

    Context-Triggered Actions:
      - "IF-THEN rules used to specify how context-aware systems should adapt"
      - "actions <u>invoked automatically</u> according to these <u>specified rules</u>"
      - "the <u>expressiveness</u> of the predicate language and the <u>accuracy</u> and <u>timeliness</u> of the underlying context information"

    Grand Challenges:
      1. Taxonomy:
        - "uniform representation of context types"
      2. Infrastructure:
        - "to promote the design, implementation, and evolution of context-aware applications"
      3. Discovery:
        - "compelling context-aware applications that assist our everyday interactions with ubiquitous computation services"
        - "focus on whole solution rather than on part solutions: people don't want X, they want solutions; bringing together technologies, including underlying database, information retrieval, theoretical foundation, HCI issues, hard AI, distributed systems"

    So What:
      - "good synergy with <u>ubiquitous computing</u>"
      - "<u>activity</u>, <u>space</u>, and <u>time</u> are types of contextual information"
      - "context can direct <u>reconfiguration</u>"
      - "understanding <u>what information is available in interactive spaces</u>"
      - "understanding <u>human intention and roles</u>"
      - "<u>informing users</u> what they are doing"
      - "allowing the user to <u>control contextual actions</u>"
      - "<u>physical</u> virtual user interfaces"
      - "<u>simple sensor to complex/smart interaction</u> or <u>complex mechanism to simple interaction</u>"

      - Title: "New Theoretical Approaches for HCI"
        Link: "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00779-004-0335-2"
        Authors: "Yvonne Rogers, ARIST'04"

    Overview:
      - "HCI is an <u>expanding</u> field (new demands and challenges): the <u>theory</u> driving the research is changing, a flurry of <u>new concepts</u> are emerging, the <u>domains and type of users</u> being studied are diversifying, and many of the <u>ways of doing designs</u> are new and much of <u>what is being designed</u> is significantly different."
      - "Also an increasing <u>lack of direction, structure, and purpose in the field</u>. What is the <u>purpose of HCI</u>? What criteria is used to assess its <u>contribution and value to knowledge and practice</u>."
      - "<u>interaction design</u> as a way of focusing more on what is being done rather the components it is being done to (human-computer interaction) - <i>the design of interactive products to support people in their everyday and working lives</i> and <i>designing spaces for human communication and interaction</i>"

    Applying Basic Research:
      - "<u>cannot simply lift theories out of an established field (Cognitive Psychology)</u>, that have been developed to explain specific phenomena about cognition, and then <u>apply them to explain other kinds of seemingly related phenomena in a different domain (HCI)</u>"
      - "real world <u>human-computer interaction is messy</u>"
      - "research on learnability and memorability command names led to inconclusive results for a generalizable design rule"

    Cognitive Modeling:
      - "directness, theory of action, MHP (model human processor) GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules)"
      - "limited scope: only reliably model computer-based tasks that involve a small set of highly routine data-entry type tasks"
      - "only modeling of performance but not error"
      - "more successful in their utility in practice"
    
    Popular Concepts:
      - "<u>explanations</u> of the capabilities and limitations of users, in terms of what they can and cannot do when performing computer-based tasks."
      - "recognition is better than recall"
      - "7 +- 2"
      - "potential catch-phrase open to interpretation"
      - "<u>informative</u> (providing useful research findings), <u>predictive</u> (providing tools to model user behaviour), <u>prescriptive</u> (providing advice as to how to design or evaluate)"

    Ecological Approach:
      - "Gaver, Kirsh, Norman, Rasmussen and Rouse, Vicente, and Woods"
      - "invariant structures in the environment in relation to human perception and action"
      - "<u>ecological constraints</u>: structures in the external world that guide people's actions rather than those that are determined by internal cognition"
      - "<u>affordances</u>: attributes of objects that allow people to know how to use them"
      - "articulating certain properties about objects at the interface in terms of their behaviour and appearance"
      - "<u>largely descriptive</u>"

    Activity Theory:
      - "<u>analyzing actions and interactions with artifacts</u> within a <u>historical and cultural context</u>; explaining cultural practices in the developmental, cultural, and historical context in which they occur, by describing them in terms of <u>activities</u>"
      - "newspaper production (Bødker), medical care in hospital (Engestrom), design of educational technology (Bellamy), and groupware (Field et al.)"
      - "Engestrom's developmental work research (including concepts like contradictions, community, rules and division of labor), Halloran's Activity Space collaborative learning framework, Spasser's realist approach for the design and use of digital libraries, and Collin's model for user requirement engineering."
      - "<u>analytical</u>: interconnected concepts that can be used to identify and explore interesting problems"
    
    External Cognition Approach:
      - "theoretical constructs that unite <u>knowledge in the head</u> with <u>knowledge in the world</u>"
      - "interaction between <u>internal and external representations</u> when performing cognitive task (e.g., learning)"
      - "independent concepts that map a <u>theoretical space</u> specifically in terms of a <u>design space</u>"
      - "<u>cognitive dimensions</u>: design vocabulary (high-level concepts) to take about design issues"
      - "<u>computational offloading</u> (how external representations reduce the amount of cognitive effort required to solve informationally equivalent problems), <u>re-representation</u> (how external representations make problem-solving easier), <u>graphical constraining</u> (the inferences that can be made about the underlying represented concept), <u>temporal and spatial constraining</u> (making relevant aspects more salient when distributed over time and space), <u>explicitness and visibility</u> (making salient aspects appropriately perceived and comprehended), <u>cognitive tracing</u> (externally manipulate and make marks on different representations), <u>ease of production</u> (of external representations), <u>combinability and modifiability</u> (of hybrid representations)"
      - "<u>largely generative</u>"

    Distributed Cognition:
      - "extending the conceptual framework to a range of cognitive systems, including socio-technical systems at large (groups of individuals interacting with each other in a particular environment)"
      - "requiring an <u>ethnographic field study</u> of the setting and paying close attention to <u>the activities of people and their interactions with material media</u>"
      - "examining how information is propagated through different media"
      - "weaving together <u>the data, the actions, the interpretations, and the ethnographic grounding</u>"
      - "explication of the complex <u>interdependencies between people and artifacts in their work activities</u>"
      - "the need for extensive field work before being able to come to any conclusions or design decisions for a given work setting"
      - "<u>largely descriptive</u> and to a lesser extent generative"

    Situated Action Approach:
      - "relations among people, and between people and the historically and culturally constituted worlds that they inhabit"
      - "relationship between <u>structures of action</u> and <u>the resources and constraints</u> afforded by physical and social circumstances"
      - "studying <u>how people use their circumstances</u> to achieve intelligent action"
      - "predominantly ethnographic"
      - "people do not act or interact with technology in the way prescribed by prescribed ideal models - carrying out extensive observations, interviews, and note-taking to understand this"
      - "focusing on the particulars of a given setting, making it difficult to generalize"
      - "<u>descriptive</u> and providing a <u>backdrop</u> for high level concepts such as context"

    Ethnomethodological Approach:
      - "<u>bottom-up sociology approach</u>, whereby working practices are described from <u>the practical accomplishment of the people</u>"
      - "<u>thick descriptive</u> of work practices"
      - "high-level socially-based concepts of <u>practical action, order, accountability, and coordination</u>"
      - "<u>system designs</u> to take on board generally operative process like situatedness, practical action, order and accountability"
      - "<u>ethnomethodology</u> to take on system design concepts like generalization, configuration, data, process and mutability"

    So What:
      - "<u>people are constantly interrupted or interrupt their own activities</u>, by talking to others, taking breaks, starting new activities, resuming other, and so on."
      - "people use technology differently than it was envisioned"
      - "<u>integrating multiple theories</u> at different levels of analysis"
      - "<u>juxtaposing and interweaving different concepts</u> from different traditions to create new perspectives and ways of thinking about a problem space"
      - "providing <u>an epistemological grounding</u> for your work"
      - "although they are familiar with the theories and approaches, <u>very few practitioners use theories</u> to interpret their findings (but <u>they use concepts derived from the theories</u>)"
      - "<u>popular concepts</u>: affordances, context, awareness, situatedness, and cognitive offloading"
      - "I also find it really difficult to apply these theories fully (in the sense that the design largely leverages them as opposed to simply incorporating good HCI principles) - <u>What do the theories</u> (or applications of concepts from the theories) <u>actually add to the existing set of ideas about design and systems?</u>"
      - "theories do not do design"
      - "<u>considerable time, effort, and skill</u> are required to understand and know how to use them"
      - "<u>which is potentially most useful</u> for the problem at hand?"
      - "<u>Five kinds of theories</u>: <u>descriptive</u> (providing concepts, clarifying terminology, and guide further inquiry), <u>explanatory</u> (explicating relationships and processes), <u>predictive</u> (enabling predictions to be made about user performance), <u>prescriptive</u> (providing guidance for design), <u>generative</u> (enabling practitioners to create or invent or discover something new)"
      - "new theoretical approaches can progress further with <u>rethinking new mechanisms of knowledge transfer</u>. <u>A lingua franca</u> so that different parties in research and design can use to refer to common referents."
      - "theoretically-based approaches -> new accounts, frameworks and concepts -> extensive design language that can be used in research and design"
      - "determining which of the new terms, metaphors, and other abstractions are useful for articulating design concerns -> <u>new dialogues</u> identifying areas of <u>conceptual richness</u> and <u>design articulation</u>"

    First Wave (Liam Bannon):
      - "cognitive science and human factors"
      - "model-driven and focused on the human being as a subject to be studied through rigid guidelines, formal methods, and systematic testing"
    
    Second Wave (Liam Bannon):
      - "from human factors to human actors"
      - "groups working with a collection of applications, work settings and interaction within well-established communities of practice"
      - "cooperation, learnining, and participation"
      - "situated action, distributed cognition, and activity theory"
      - "important concepts like context and affordances, and methods like participatory design, prototyping"

    Third Wave (Bødker):
      - "context and application types broadened and intermixed, technology spread from the workplace to our homes and everyday lives and culture"
      - "experience and meaning-making"
      - "individual experience vs. sharing and learning from each other within communities of practice, and participation in shared development and appropriation of technology (second wave)"

    Ten Years Later:
      - "<i>Whether we have become better at studying these multiple, experience-based use situations, <u>methodically, empirically, or conceptually</u></i>"
      - "configuration of multitudes of artifacts"
      - "technologies are appropriated and reappropriated into networks of technological infrastructures and use situations, or using participatory methods to rethink design in these cases"
      - "bringing technologies, experiences, and users across domains, some of which ware work, others not, and how we may conceptualize and study these open-ended relationships; new connections between rationality and work, between work and leisure"
      - "go beyond embracing individual experience as it develops over time"

    Interaction As Common:
      - "how technological artifacts are brought together in configurations that change over time; they come and go due to changing circumstances, activities, or newly acquired skills"
      - "users' shared capacities and experiences are bound to shared practices, joint activities, and so on in artifact ecologies"
      - "shared and equal participation (activity) of professioanls and rest-of-life users"
      - "visibility of the emergent forms of devices, and the visibility of meaning and meaning-making"
      - "participation and sharing are together"

    So What:
      - "What is the role of technology in the midst of constant multi-tasking of and switching between activities?"
      - "HCI is in the middle of a chaos of multiplicity in terms of technologies, use situations, methods, and concepts"

    Overview:
      - "support <u>human activity</u> by managing its collection of work tasks on a computer"
      - "support <u>mobility</u> by distributing activities across heterogeneous computing environments"
      - "support <u>asynchronous collaboration</u> by allowing several people to participate in an activity"
      - "support <u>synchronous, real-time collaboration</u> by enabling desktop conferencing by sharing the activity across several clients"
      - "user activities become <u>first-class entities</u>"
      - "<u>abstraction</u>: activity, application, and data"

    Activity Theory:
      - "human activity <u>directed towards a material or ideal object</u> which distinguishes one activity from another (satisfying a need and the subject's reflection of, and expectation to, this object characterises the <u>motive of the activity</u>)"
      - "activity is <u>mediated by artifacts</u> (tools, language, etc)"
      - "<u>social within a culture</u>; computer artifacts mediate human activity within a practice"
      - "human knowledge about the world is <u>reflection obtained through activity</u>"
      - "activities realized through <u>chains of actions</u>, which are carried out through <u>operations</u>, and yield <u>objective results</u>. These actions are controlled by the subject's <u>conscious goals</u>. "
      - "<u>anticipation</u>: the motive of the activity, the goal of the action, and the orienting basis of the operation"

    Leontiev:
      - "<u>subject-object</u> model"
      - "<u>subjects have needs, and they carry out activities</u> (interaction with the world through interaction with objects) <u>to meet these needs</u>."
      - "activities and their subjects <u>mutually determine one another</u>"
      - "objects have objective meaning determined by their relationship with other entities existing in the world, including the subject"
      - "<u>the objectives of objects</u> include not only the <u>physical propoerties</u> but also the <u>social and cultural properties</u>."
      - "<u>predmet</u>: object with a relevance of the entity to certain human purposes or interests"
      - "<u>tool mediation</u>: a form of accumulation and transmission of social, cultural knowledge."
      - "interrnalization and externalization and development"
      - "individuals as social creatures acting in social contexts"

    Engestrom:
      - "<u>activity system model</u>: a model of collective activity"
      - "<u>subject-object-community</u> model -> networks of activity systems"
      - "activity systems are <u>constantly developing</u>"
      - "collective activities carried out by groups and organizations"

    Activity Theory in HCI:
      - "dealing with issues of motivation, meaning, culture, and social interactions"
      - "general theoretical insights from a richer conceptual framewwork"
      - "analytical framework for design and devaluation of interactive systems and the development of analytical tools"
      - "activity-centric computing/systems"
      - "people (subjects) interact with the world through computers (objects)"
      - "artefacts defined in terms of mediating means (activity theory), equipment (phenomenology), or processing and transmission of information (distributed cognition and external cognition)"
      - "human agency"

    A Human Activity Approach to User Interfaces:
      - "a computer application is not something that the user operates on but <u>something that the user operates through on objects or subjects of interest in the work activity</u>"
      - our repertoire of <u>actions and operations is evolving continuously</u> and is <u>based on the experiences</u> that we gain as individuals and as group"
      - "<u>operations are triggered by specific situations</u>"
      - "<u>situation breakdowns</u>: unforeseen changes in the material conditions in the activity; they provide learning opportunities"
      - "various situations for handling the an object or subject through computer-based artifact"
      - "an user interface should <u>support the intended or operationalized shifts</u> in relation to the <u>use activity</u> (often inefficient and restrictive for more competent users)"
      - "specific or general <u>domain of competence</u>"

    Activity-based Computing Principles:
      - "<u>task and material</u>: activity as a collection of tasks which uses or manipulates some materials; decoupling between services and applications"
      - "<u>time and space</u>: a user has a range of activities which s/he alternates between; activities are stateful; activities can be initiated, suspended, resumed, or finalized; interruptions and multi-tasking; activities support mobility in time and space"
      - "<u>users</u>: activities are shared and collaborative, synchronous and asynchronous"

    Activity-based Computing Framework:
      - "<u>development and deployment</u> of ABC applications - a programming framework and a runtime infrastructure"
      - "<u>activity store</u>, <u>activity manager</u>, <u>activity controller</u>, and <u>collaboration controller</u>"
      - "<u>a workflow system</u> is not just mediating the workflow, but is used for additional managerial purposes - a technology of accountability aimed at inscription and documentation of actions to which parties are accountable"

    Mobility:
      - "activity suspend and resume across devices, spaces, and time"
      - "enabling users to move between publicly available devices (activities can be suspended in one place on one device and resumed in another place on another device)"

    Collaboration:
      - "synchronous (real-time activity sharing) and asynchronous (resuming and working within a shared activity)"
      - "session management"
      - "state management"
      - "shared state synchronization"
      - "peer-to-peer collaboration"

    Plans and Work:
      - "plans as <u>an artifact of our reasoning about actions</u>, not ... the generative mechanism of action (used to <u>reflect on work, before and after</u>)"
      - "based on experience about <u>recurrent structures in life</u>; a series of <u>expectations to future results</u>"
      - "plans as situated actions; <u>situated planning</u>: building, altering, sharing, executing, and monitoring plans within the cooperative work activities"
      - "involving <u>coordination</u> and <u>collaboration</u>"
      - "<u>informal vs. formal</u> work"
      - "<u>actions are polymotivated</u>"

    So What:
      - "Thought-provoking: <u>activity as first-class entities</u> (human activity as the basic component in purposeful human work)"
      - "An organization has to be viewed as <u>a collection of multiple activities</u>, each realizing different needs. Some of these activities are directed toward the object of the organization, and others are directed toward an organizational accountability of work. Motives of all involved actors should be recognized and satisfied."
      - "<u>We design new conditions for collective activity</u> (e.g., new division of labor and other ways of coordination, control, and communication)."
      - "<u>The user interface cannot be seen independently of the goal or object of the activity</u> and of other conditions of the use activity. Analysis and design should be done by people with enough domain knowledge to help interpret the occurring breakdowns."
      - "<u>A good user interface is flexible</u> so that the user is able to conduct an activity as different actions and operations depending on <u>the user's repertoire of operations and the actual material conditions</u>. This seems related to the ideas of <u>inclusive design</u>."
      - "How do users lay out all of their activities? at a certain point in time and across time. Cross-activity integration across social contexts and digital and non-digital artefacts"
      - "How can the user achieve what he or she wants and how this relates to his or her practice within the domain? How can activity theory be operationalized? How can we analyze and improve subjective experiences of everyday activities through technology"

    Overview:
      - "<i>The most profound research topics are those that disappear</i>"
      - "mainframes (many to one) -> personal computing (one to one) -> ubiquitous computing (one to many) -> collective computing (many to many)?"
      - "<u>cloud</u>: distributed computing of storage and computation - don't need to worry about the device"
      - "<u>crowd</u>: source information from a number of people and human computation"
      - "<u>shroud</u>: covering of the physical world that provides connection of all the devices (internet of things and wearables)"
      - "using the cloud to merge data from the shroud with intelligence from the crowd rapidly empowers the individual with specialized expertise beyond her training - the individual can harness on-demand expertise"

    Ubiquitous Computing and Collecting Computing:
      - "ubicomp: blurring the distinction between the physical and digital world"
      - "the shroud as a connected layer of devices on people and things"
      - "<u>mass fabrication of materials</u> with <u>embedded computational capabilities in everyday objects</u>"
      - "disposable computing artefacts like post-it notes"

    Computational Skin:
      - "the 5th generation of computing"
      - "<u>surface of any object</u> being able to perform basic <u>computational operations</u> - store information, compute logical operations, communicate within and between surfaces through contact, sense and actuate, harvest their own power to perform the above"
      - "rethink wireless communication"

    Applications and Scenarios:
      - "be you own {tour guide, health advisor, teacher, ...}"
      - "Campus Life: tracking physical, mental, and academic performance - empowering students to be their own medical counselors"
      - "<u>understanding individuals</u>, <u>communities</u>, and <u>organizations</u>"
      - "<u>computational skins</u>: classrooms (maker's activities, exams, prototyping, collaboration), asset tracking (indoor localization), food safety, voting (paper + digital ballot), whole living spaces"

    So What:
      - "the groups of people in interactive spaces are <u>crowds at a smaller scale</u>"
      - "<u>collective interactive spaces?</u>"
      - "How does one establish a presence/identity in such spaces? Or register his or her collection of private or shared devices?"

    Overview:
      - "<u>interaction mediated by proxemics</u>"
      - "<u>interactive spaces</u> consisting of fixed and semi-fixed features (ecologies of digital artefacts)"

    Framework:
      - "<u>5 proxemic dimensions</u>: distance, orientation, movement, identity, location"
      - "<u>4 proxemic zones</u>: intimate, personal, social, public (supporting different input modalities and interactions)"
      - "<u>3 action spaces</u>: o-space, p-space, r-space"
      - "<u>social theories</u>: proxemic theory and F-formations"

    Applications and Scenarios:
      - "<u>proxemic interactive systems</u>: Ballendat's media player, proxemic-aware displays, surfaces, and installations, spatially-aware mobile devices supporting cross-device interaction and small-group activities"
      - "<u>visualizations of ubicomp spaces</u>: supporting device discovery, conveying interaction possibilities, and enabling spontaneous interactions)"

    Grand Challenges:
      1. Revealing Interaction Possibilities:
        - "Weiser: most profound technologies disappear…"
        - "transitioning from background to foreground interaction"
        - "directing user's attention (metaphor: greeting)"
      2. Directing Actions:
        - "multimodal input (speech, gesture, gaze, and touch, etc) as actions to the system or just a part of a person's activity?"
        - "motion cues (and understanding the entire physical space)"
      3. Establishing Connections:
        - "supporting interaction needs while safeguarding privacy and security (personal, private, and public relationships)"
        - "different form factors demand different mobilities"
        - "progressive (discrete or continuous) connection and interaction"
      4. Providing Feedback:
        - "application status (or errors) and its interpretation of user input, accounting for users’ attention"
        - "output modalities (sound, speech, perception, movement)"
      5. Avoiding and Correcting Mistakes:
        - "more user-control (mechanisms for correcting errors and misinterpretations of e.g., from the use sensing technologies)"
        - "inverting actions (stepping out of the interaction zone)"
        - "undoing actions / overriding the system (towards direct manipulation)"
        - "using proxemic safeguards (requiring certain proxemic relationships for actions with a high impact)"
      6. Managing Privacy and Security:
        - "protect privacy-sensitive information and handle access to information"
        - "not get in the way of doing things (points 1-5)"
        - "compensation, balance, and privacy"
        - "proximity-dependent authentication"
        - "distance-dependent information disclosure"
        - "proxemic-aware privacy mechanisms (considering orientation, identity, and location)"
        - "considering people's expectations (levels of privacy for everyone involved, their social relationships, balancing privacy through proxemics)"

    So What:
      - "<u>GREAT WORK!!!</u> <u>REALLY COOL</u> New design thinking for ubicomp interactive systems and cross-device interaction!!!"
      - "I think proxemic interaction is a focus perspective of context-aware computing"
      - "towards <u>ad hoc device ecologies</u> - activity, space, and time - and <u>reconfigurable interactive spaces</u>"
      - "<u>identity</u> - what about social relationships? implications for proxemic interaction design (proxemic social contact)?"
      - "<u>cultural differences</u> (concepts of personal spaces and space invasion) not discussed"
      - "<u>deliberately violating expectations</u> of proxemic interaction in certain applications (e.g., close physical interaction or human interaction/activity)"
      - "<u>social concerns</u> about privacy, errors, distraction, and intrusion"
      - "<u>dark patterns</u> (Greenberg et al., DIS'14'): captive audience, attention grabber, bait and switch, making personal information public, we never forget, disguised data collection, social network of proxemic contacts or unintended social relationships, and the milk factor. Opt-in and opt-out mechanisms? New user-defined interaction possibilities?"
      - "<u>proxemic interaction challenges</u> (Greenberg et al., DIS'14'): opt-in/opt-out choices, physical space is imbued with dual meanings, ownership of the physical space is ambiguous, attention is inherently sought after (being in a space but opted out of the interactive system), accidental proxemics (interaction with context-aware systems), balancing between implicit and explicit interaction, making users aware of what is happening, "
      - "<u>design implications</u> for the Physical Web and IoT. Cloud vs. local infrastructures."
      - "Proxemic theory also applies to the dis-abled (visually impaired/blind people have good spatial awareness, they know whether the other person talking is facing them, and more) but most cross-device interactions still rely heavily on visual cues. Would be very interesting to work on <u>accessibility issues</u> in cross-device interaction (This is a big topic, perhaps a PhD by itself) so it'd require collaboration. I think the big problem is helping them connect with people, feel loved, do essential/meaningful work, and enhance their own abilities/interests (ability-based design), etc (somewhat universal to all humans). Technologies (e.g., cross-device interaction) are just tools, so creating the right tool for the right purpose/problem is important (inclusive design)."

      - "implicit vs explicit reveal"
      - "revealing content on personal vs. public devices"

    Techniques for Information Transfer Between Devices:

      - "single person transfer (from personal to public device) and collaborative transfer"
      - "large display drag and back (from a distance)"
      - "cross-device portal drag to transfer (from a distance)"
      - "point and edit (from a distance)"
      - "direct touch: drag in and out (close proximity)"
      - "collaborative handoff (from a distance)"
      - "drag between a public intermediary (close proximity)"

    Applications and Scenarios:
      - "interaction techniques that fit into various stages of gradual engagement"
      - "Proxemic Brainstorming: a multi-user, interactive digital brainstorming tool"

    Grand Challenges:
      1. Further Exploration of Design Patterns and Interaction Techniques for UbiComp Systems:
      2. Adapting Large Ecologies of People and Devices:
      3. Gradual Engagement and Privacy:
        - "contexts: public and private spaces"
        - "implicit protection rules in personal settings"
        - "explicit actions and commands on the device to stop sharing and close inter-device connections"
      4. Pattern applied to different tracking hardware:
        - "diverse tracking capabilities along a low/high fidelity spectrum"

    So What:
      - "<u>GREAT WORK!!!</u> New design framework looking at which, what, and how of information exchange between devices through the lens of proxemics"
      - "however devices are assumed already connected, and both people and devices are Vicon-tracked. What is the minimum setup for ad hoc interaction? How to design <u>outdoor interactive spaces</u>?"
      - "built for interactive displays. How about gradually engaging f-formations of small and large groups? How to design technologies to support these new kinds of <u>spontaneous walk-up-and-use scenarios</u>? What would the entire interaction phases look like?"

      - "<u>design principles</u> and an <u>interaction framework</u> for sharable, interactive public ambient displays that support the transition from implicit to explicit interaction with both public and personal information"
      - "<u>4 discrete interaction phases</u>"

    Design:
      - "<u>Calm Aesthetics</u>: interface subtly reacts to inputs and fluidly signals state changes"
      - "<u>Comprehension</u>: information must be comprehensible, and meaning can be discovered through subtle interaction"
      - "<u>Notification</u>: notify and communicate in a socially acceptable manner based on their level of attention and openness to receiving more information"
      - "<u>Short-Duration Fluid Interaction</u>: interaction for supporting short duration activities - initiating and ending an interaction should be fast and seamless"
      - "<u>Immediate Usability</u>: learning by exploration"
      - "<u>Shared Use</u>: share the system either individually or collaboratively"
      - "<u>Combining Public and Personal Information</u>"
      - "<u>Privacy</u>: explicit interaction to hide notifications and minimize their implicit interaction"

    Framework:
      - "<u>Ambient Display</u>: overall information space at a quick glance"
      - "<u>Implicit Interaction</u>: intelligently measure user's interruptibility (head orientation, body movement and location), using subtle notifications to draw users closer to the display"
      - "<u>Subtle Interaction</u>: public information augmented with person information, enabling users to interact with the display through simple explicit actions (e.g., gestures). Usually short interaction duration (1 minute) for displaying harmless personal information"
      - "<u>Personal Interaction</u>: direct touch interaction (2-5 minutes) but minimal disruption to the rest of the display"

    Interaction Techniques:
      - "<u>Proximity Reveal</u>: overview to personal visualization"
      - "<u>Reaching</u>: palm vertical + selection point; Shifting: body movement"
      - "<u>User Proximity Bar</u>, <u>Peripheral Notification</u>, <u>Hide and Show Actions</u>: stop and go"

      - "<u>Visual feedback</u> for posture recognition and the action to be performed (further actions are indicated via small icons)"
      - "<u>Help</u> mechanisms: video demonstrating available actions"

    Informal User Study:
      - "<u>talk-aloud</u>: whether participants understand the meaning of ambient displays and initiate different interaction phases, and if they realize hand gestures could be used"
      - "<u>further exploration</u>: whether participants could perform the gestures - they found the interactive icons helpful, discovered how to navigate the timeline, and initiated touch interaction"
      - "<u>exit thresholds</u> were not conveyed"
      - "<u>no feedback</u> about the posture recognition (success and failures), feedback about correcting their posture, or the system could adapt the posture as the correct initiator for that user"

    Grand Challenges:
      1. In-the-Wild Deployments:
      2. User Identification:
      3. Cross-Device Interaction:
      4. Multi-User Collaboration:
      5. Remote Interaction:

    So What:
      - "<u>GREAT WORK!!!</u> New design framework and interaction techniques for interacting with large shared displays!!!"
      - "<u>visual cues</u> are powerful. I think <u>audio</u> and <u>tacile</u> feedback are also important - but how to design them for multi-device environments? How to effectively combine on-display visualizations with floor and other peripheral visualizations?"
      - "I really like <u>different phases of interaction</u>. What are the different phases of reconfiguration of interactive spaces?

      - "there could be unthinkable thoughts...but we could build <u>tools</u>!!"
      - "<u>solving</u> vs. <u>searching</u>"

      - "<u>spatial references</u> of other devices in the user's device (relative location of devices surrounding an user), facilitating the use of <u>direct manipulation</u> techniques for interaction with target devices"
      - "supporting collocated collaboration"

    RELATE Interaction Model and System:
      - "<u>network discovery</u> and <u>spatial sensing</u> (spatial relationships between devices)"
      - "<u>visualization</u> of available target devices in a spatial layout that reflect device locations relative to the user's device (devices visualized as icons)"
      - "<u>direct manipulation</u> techniques for user-initiated interaction and communication (document exchange such as drag-and-drop files and chat)"

      - "<u>fine-grained positioning in real-time</u>"

    Applications and Scenarios:

    Informal Feedback:
      - "<u>imperfect sensing data</u> and loss of measurements resulted in significant jitter in the visualization"
      - "positioning accuracy decreases as the number of devices decreases"
      - "users are <u>sensitive to proportionality</u> - relative accuracy is more important than absolute accuracy, e.g., more important for user interface to reflect equal spacing between devices"
      - "<u>map visualization confusing</u> (many expect a top-view visualization) and also <u>taking up large screen space</u> (however spatial references are peripheral tasks over main activities such as note-taking or browsing documents) -> Relate Gateway design"

    Spatial Discovery and Access to Services:
      - "devices and services represented as <u>Relate Gateways</u> arranged <u>around edge of the screen</u> (physical metaphor: compass)"
      - "gateways support drag-and-drop operations and buttons to open various service menus"

      - "displayed <u>interaction zones</u> around devices based on user distance, orientation, and movement"

    Wizard of Oz Study of the Relate Gateways Interface:
      - "human operator provides the relative device positions: to remove <u>fluctuating sensor performance</u> and instead focus on the <u>usability of the gateway concept</u>"
      - "gateway interface is <u>more easily understood</u>"
      - "arrangement of gateways around the edge of the screen is <u>effective, easier to locate, and intuitive</u>"

    Techniques for Group Association:
      - "biometric, brain, button, device touch, drawing, eye, gesture, hologram, image, proximity, search-and-select, services, tactile, token, voice"

    User-Defined Action Studies (Guessability Study):
      - "participants presented with the end effect of an action and asked to perform its cause - enabling ordinary users to define gestures for a variety of input functions and activities"
      - "<u>users cannot relinquish the possession of their devices to another user</u>"
      - "plastic prop devices used: <u>tiny computers, mobile phone, tablet, flexible computer, and situated display</u>"
      - "participants with non-technical background (e.g., no computer science majors)"
      - "<u>49 distinguishable techniques</u>"
      - "most popular: <u>bend a shape</u>, <u>physical contact</u>, and <u>pointing</u>"
      - "search-and-select: no substantial portion, suggested when participants struggled to provide an association technique, not easy to use (<u>text entry</u> and <u>close proximity</u> were popular but not rated highly for easiness)"
      - "<u>popularity does not correlate with ease of use</u>"

    Prevailing Techniques:
      - "all tiny computers or all tablets: <u>physical contact</u>"
      - "all tiny computers + a situated display / mobile phones: <u>pointing</u>"
      - "mobile phones are used like a <u>remote controller</u> (also search-and-select with mobile phones)"
      - "all tablets + a situated display: <u>align the tablets towards the display</u> (barcode or snap a picture)"
      - "flexible computers: <u>sandwich</u> and <u>stacking</u>, <u>pointing not favoured</u> - the flexible form factor does not support a pointing direction - or <u>roll-and-point</u> when a situated display is included"

    General Patterns:
      - "mobile devices: <u>physical contact</u> and <u>stacking</u> (<u>mobility</u> allows the action of bringing devices to touch and release); <u>physical contact is instantaneous</u>"
      - "situated display: <u>pointing</u>, <u>barcode</u>, and <u>snap a picture</u>; display as <u>the central unit</u> (people prefer to operate on the largest interface, the display is shared, and spatial manipulation of the display is impossible, so <u>users manipulate their mobile devices to accommodate the display</u>)"
      - "physical contact: edges or corners in contact, very seldom that they tapped  a dvice on the flat surface of another device (same observation found in single-operator device association)"
      - "flexible computers: left and right sides are most frequently used, no one used the bottom area; <u>bending requires the relative spatial positions of nearby devices</u>"

    Roles of End-Users in Device Association:
      - "<u>guidance</u>: steering the devices into <u>finding one another</u> to form a group; real-world experience like scanning the barcode. Examples: <u>throwing</u>, <u>pointing</u>, <u>snap a picture</u>, <u>swiping</u>, <u>physical contact</u>, <u>close proximity</u>, <u>stacking devices</u>."
      - "<u>input</u>: devices as <u>an instrument for capturing information</u> (generated by the input action, e.g., shape/gesture) for device association; actions that can be performed on individual devices like connecting the dots on Android devices. Examples: <u>asynchronous presses</u>, <u>shaking</u>, <u>voice command</u>, <u>pick an option</u>, <u>draw a symbol</u>."
      - "<u>enrolment</u>: devices as <u>nameable and identifiable objects</u> with an enrolled identity; identities can be unique like the owner's biometrics. Examples: <u>face recognition</u>, <u>social network</u>, <u>fingerprint</u>, <u>emailing/texting</u>, <u>web service</u>."

    Insights:
      - "<u>device form factor</u> influences participants' conceptualization of device association'"
      - "techniques are selected based on the device's <u>physicality</u> (e.g., physical contact for tiny computers and pointing for larger mobile devices), and <u>touch-based interaction is best in mobile-only scenarios</u>"
      - "people prefer <u>physical contact when mobility is supported</u>"
      - "participants assume <u>personal devices are personalized</u> - requires trust of devices"
      - "<u>guidance embraces reality-based interaction</u>"
      - "<u>user roles demand particular user attention</u>: guidance-based techniques require attention to the <u>location of the target devices</u>, input-based techniques require attention to <u>users' own devices</u>, enrolment-based techniques require attention to the <u>identities of the target devices</u>"

      - "I like <u>guessability study</u>. Could it be applied to something for <u>cross-device / device ecologies concepts</u>? Need more thoughts."
      - "I think there's a concept gap - a person associates multiple devices by performing multiple <u>one-to-one</u> techniques but proposes <u>one-to-many</u> (or <u>collaborative</u>) techniques when they are in a group. How can a single person associate multiple devices using <u>many-to-many</u> techniques on their own?"
      - "What if there are <u>multiple ways</u> of associating devices, <u>like multiple ways of bringing papers together</u>? How can a group coordinate which technique to use? How can technologies support this decision process? Same for configuration work and cross-device interaction."

        Link: "http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=303010"
        Authors: "Streitz, Geibler, Holmer, Konomi, Muller-Tomfelde, Reischl, Rexroth, Seitz, Steinmetz, CHI'99"

    Overview:
      - "innovative workspaces (of the future) consisting of virtual information spaces and real architectural spaces"
      - "for individuals and groups"
      - "an interface to information which can be represented in many more different forms"

    Integrated Design of Information and Architectural Spaces:
      - "<u>information spaces</u>: information is created, stored, and communicated through digital artefacts; interfaces to information are realized as displays of desktop computers or via virtual reality gadgets"
      - "<u>architectural spaces</u>: distribution and availability of physical objects, physical layout of the workspace; information and cooperation spaces; constraining group activities due to the flexibility of the furniture and access to multiple information devices"
      - "physical objects and their placement in the architectural space provide valuable <u>affordances</u> for <u>organizing content information and meta information</u>"
      - "these affordances should be <u>complemented by augmenting the physical environment by the rich information available in digital information spaces</u>"
      - "presenting this <u>invisible information</u> via <u>dynamic physical objects</u> in correspondence with the <u>changing underlying digital information</u>"

    New Work Practices:
      - "work and cooperation characterized by a degree of <u>dynamics</u>, <u>flexibility</u>, and <u>mobility</u>"
      - "<u>contents</u>, <u>participants</u>, <u>contexts</u>, <u>tasks</u>, <u>processes</u>, and <u>structures of collaboration</u> change frequently"
      - "design of equally <u>dynamic, flexible, and mobile</u> work environments - <u>high spatial flexibility</u> and <u>mobility</u> of the information devices"

    Applications and Scenarios:
      - "innovative support tools for creative teams, working in the areas of strategic planning, identifying future trends, designing and marketing new products, etc"
      - "<u>ad hoc communication and collaboration</u>: spontaneous sketching and annotating on interactive surfaces (storing and later modifying these creations)"
      - "ways for subgroups to <u>split off during the meeting in the same workspace</u>: do their work, rejoin, and then immediately merge the result"
      - "<u>flexible and reconfigurable (dynamically and on-demand)</u> components and resources: to meet the different requirements of changing team work situations (<u>the space is context-aware</u>)"

    Technological Framework:
      - "<u>Reactive Environments</u>: augmented reality and ubiquitous computing"

    Empirical Study:
      - "the room should provide opportunities for spontaneous encounters and informal communication (like a marketplace or a landscape)"
      - "physical objects should be multifunctional and flexible"
      - "support for <u>information gathering</u>, <u>creativity techniques</u> (for flexible configuration or tailoring of the underlying rules), <u>presentation styles</u>, <u>visualizations</u> inspiring and enhancing creative process, <u>communicating</u> and <u>experiencing content</u> (also via other channels: acoustic and tactile)"
      - "<u>physical personal presence</u> is important"
      - "computer should be in the background"
      - "freedom in (re)configuring their physical and virtual environments"

    Roomware Components:
      - "<u>DynaWall</u> (interactive surfaces), <u>InteracTable</u> (tabletops), <u>CommChairs</u> (mobile and networked chairs with slate computers)"
      - "DynaWall: <u>take and put</u> (pick and drop) and <u>shuffle</u> (throw and catch)"
      - "<u>CommChair</u>: communicate and share information with people in other chairs, standing in front of the DynaWall or around the InteracTable; a private workspace but also can interact remotely on shared workspaces"
      - "<u>InteracTable</u>: creation, display, discussion and annotation of information objects by a group standing around it; touch, pen and finger gestures enabled; gestures for rotating and shuffling information objects"
      - "<u>passage</u>: ephemeral binding of content to a physical object"
      - "some initial ideas about the use of proxemics (identity, location, orientation) for collaborative tasks"

    So What:
      - "<u>i-LAND</u> is what I thought as <u>large-scale interactive spaces</u> + sensing of people, devices, workflows and activities + peripheral visualization / feedback + user control (maybe there are multiple layers of an interactive space)"
      - "This has actually become <u>a reality</u> now. Cool!"
      - "I like the differentiation between <u>full group</u> and <u>subgroups</u>, with various device ecologies distributed in the same space"
      - "and incorporating <u>tangible bits</u> into interactive spaces - I think it's super important to integrate both virtual and physical worlds (until it becomes indistinguishable from one another)"
      - "another <u>very inspiring work!!!</u> I like how the old papers have really good ideas."
